# Introduction-to-Portfolio-Construction-and-Analysis-with-Python
Notebook based on the course "Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python" from EDHEC Business School I took on Coursera.

If you would like to download the notebooks and use them, please, add the file edhec_risk_kit.py to the folder in which the other Python libraries/modules are located in your computer. This is a file that gathers most of the functions that were built during the course.

Bear in mind that there are some functions, in particular the ones that read CSV, that are pretty slow. The reason why they may be slow is briefly documented along each of them in the file edhec_risk_kit.

I would like to apologize for any errors that you may find. These notebooks were meant for individual learning, but I thought that someone may find them interesting to look at.

If you would like to contact me, please send an e-mail to jacoboosorio1d@gmail.com.

Thank you very much for your attention.
