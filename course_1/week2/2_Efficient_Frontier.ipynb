Another thing that we should point out is that Food and Smoke have the most seemingly normal behaviour (Gaussian and Cornish-Fisher VaR are very similar). We can check if this is true by having a look at the skewness and kurtosis. In some sense, this can make sense, as both smoking and eating  should not have frequent extreme deviations (steady amount of consumers and consumption). However, I would guess that if we divide food into different industries, we would see a lot of deviations from normality."
